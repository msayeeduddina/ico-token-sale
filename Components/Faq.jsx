                              While profits are possible trading
                              cryptocurrencies, so are losses. My first year
                              involved me spending hundreds of hours trading
                              Bitcoin with a result of losing over $5,000 with
                              nothing to show for it. Simply trading digital
                              currencies is very similar to gambling because no
                              one really knows what is going to happen next
                              although anyone can guess! While I was lucky to do
                              nothing expect lose money when I started, the
                              worst thing that can happen is to get lucky right
                              away and get a big ego about what an amazing

                              Before Steem I was all in an another altcoin and
                              really excited about it. When I first bought the
                              price was low and made payments to me every week
                              just for holding it. As I tried to participate in
                              the community over the next several months, I was
                              consistently met with a mix of excitement and
                              hostility. When I began talking openly about this,
                              the negative emotions won over in the community
                              and in me. Originally I had invested and been
                              happy to hold no matter what the price which
                              quickly went up after I bought it.

                              cryptocurrencies, so are losses. My first year

                              Bitcoin with a result of losing over $5,000 with

                              one really knows what is going to happen next
                              although anyone can guess! While I was lucky to do

                              worst thing that can happen is to get lucky right

                              Before Steem I was all in an another altcoin and
                              really excited about it. When I first bought the
                              price was low and made payments to me every week
                              just for holding it. As I tried to participate in
                              the community over the next several months, I was
                              consistently met with a mix of excitement and
                              hostility. When I began talking openly about this,
                              the negative emotions won over in the community
                              and in me. Originally I had invested and been
                              happy to hold no matter what the price which
                              quickly went up after I bought it.

                              due to cases where someone buys bitcoins with

                              When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of
                              removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins
                              still remain in the block chain just like any

                              dormant forever because there is no way for
                              anybody to find the private key(s) that would
                              allow them to be spent again. Because of the law
                              of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are
                              available, the ones that are left will be in
                              higher demand and increase in value to compensate.

                              due to cases where someone buys bitcoins with

                              When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of
                              removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins
                              still remain in the block chain just like any
                              other bitcoins. However, lost bitcoins remain
                              dormant forever because there is no way for
                              anybody to find the private key(s) that would
                              allow them to be spent again. Because of the law
                              of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are
                              available, the ones that are left will be in
                              higher demand and increase in value to compensate.

                              scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based
